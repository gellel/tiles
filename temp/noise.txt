noise notes: 

frequency:
	- Frequency zoom:
		- when supplying noise2d with x and y, using the formula (x - width / 2) centers the zoom for the x axis; same is true for the y axis (y - height / 2). 
			- this rule works for any corner. if you only use (x - width) you will zoom top right

water:
	- Curve.sin: 
		- supplying noise with a: 0 and b: 0.1 create interesting water based maps

	- Curve.bezier:
		- creating a bezier function would allow the noise falloff to be scaled to create more islands reliably
